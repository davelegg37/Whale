		<div>The Whale’s Song</div>
		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>In the time long ago when the earth was covered with ocean, there lived at the bottom of a small sea the Thorgs. The Thorgs were bottom feeders and spent their days with their noses in the mud searching for sea grubs and other slimy morsels.</div>
		<div>In this time long ago the creatures of the world could not talk, so the world was silent except for the sounds of the wind and the sea. Mother Nature, growing tired of the quiet, decided to give creatures the ability to speak and she chose the Thorgs to be the first to receive her gift.</div>
		<div>Unfortunately the first Thorg to receive the gift of speech had just had his tail bumped by another Thorg, so the first words heard on earth were, "Get off my tail, you jerk!"  This was followed by the reply of the second Thorg, "You were feeding in my area, stupid."</div>
		<div> These initial words uttered by the first Thorgs set the pattern for all future communication, and from that day on the sea bottom was filled with bickering, name calling and hate.  Mother Nature, distraught over the results of her experiment, decided not to tinker with the earth any more and withdrew to other worlds. From now on any changes on earth would be left to Chance.</div>
		<div>Now Chance, unlike Mother Nature, does not consciously bring about change but he does change things.  One day by chance there appeared a new type of young Thorg. This one was different then all the rest. He had a very big head and mouth but a very little throat which made it impossible for him to talk like the other Thorgs.</div>
		<div>When the young Thorg opened his large mouth to speak, out came a long string of sounds that floated through the ocean </div>
		<div>engulfing the surrounding sea and it’s creatures in a melodic envelope. The sea and it’s creatures were unified by the song and their individual beauty  was enhanced by that unification. That is all of the sea except for the Thorgs.</div>
		<div>The Thorgs, who had used their gift of speech to fight and find fault with each other, were no longer capable of seeing the beauty in which they lived. They made fun of the young Thorg. "You are ugly," they said. "With that big mouth and head you will never be a good bottom feeder. You can't talk; all you can do is wail." And they began to refer to him as the wailer, which became shortened to whale.</div>
		<div>The whale, as he was now called, was saddened by the hostility and rejection of the Thorgs.   So he left the bottom of the sea. He traveled where no Thorg had ever gone. He swam near the surface where sunlight filtered through a watery lens, creating a kaleidoscope of ever changing patterns. </div>
		<div>He traveled to the shallow seas through the serene gardens of corals and sea weeds that grew there. </div>
		<div>He swam in oceans cold and wild and oceans warm and peaceful. He swam in beautiful clouds of shimmering fish, </div>
		<div>and laughed with the porpoise as they tried to catch rides on his broad back. Each new vision and each new experience was added to his song, until the beauty of the entire ocean was captured in the complexity of the refrain.</div>
		<div>But the young whale was still sad. The fish swam together, the sea fronds grew together, the sharks hunted together but he was all alone and his song began to sadden. Then one day, faintly from somewhere far away he thought he heard another song.</div>
		<div>Maybe it was just an echo of one his earlier songs but he had to find out. </div>
		<div>The young whale swam for days following the new song.  Until in a distant sea among a group of bottom feeding Throgs he found her.</div>
		<div>She looked like him and when she opened her large mouth her song filled the sea around him. Their two songs blended in a duet that sounded throughout the oceans of the earth.  Over the years their children and their grandchildren and their great grandchildren joined their voices in creating their lovely songs of the sea which knit the oceans of the world into the magnificent watery tapestry they are today.</div>
		<div>Mother Nature had avoided earth for years, not wanting to be reminded of her failed experiment with the Throgs. One day, however, her journey to a nearby world took her close to the earth and in passing she heard the wonderful symphony emanating from it's blue oceans. She quickly revisited the Throgs to find out what had changed."It's those Whales," came the sour reply. "For years now their songs have been getting louder and louder. Its gotten to the point that we can't even carry on a good fight."She smiled,  once again Chance had intervened to save her from her own mistakes.                                                          The End</div>
